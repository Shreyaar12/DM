# Data Mining Class ELA 1 Assignment SHREYA RAJPAL 21BBS0202

## Overview

This repository contains the files and datasets required for completing the ELA 1 assignment of the Data Mining class. The assignment consists of four questions that involve data analysis and Python programming to demonstrate various data mining techniques.

## File Structure

- **employee_data.csv**: This dataset contains employee-related information used for one of the analysis questions.
- **prices_industryoil.csv**: This dataset contains historical prices and industry-related data for oil, which is required for one of the analysis questions.
- **services.csv**: This dataset provides information on services, used in one of the analysis questions.
- **python.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the solutions to Questions 1, 2, and 4. The notebook includes code, outputs, and explanations for each step taken to solve the questions.
- **new.py**: A Python script that contains the solution to Question 3, which is handled separately in this file.

## Questions and Corresponding Files

- **Question 1**: Data analysis performed using the `employee_data.csv` dataset. The solution is provided in the `python.ipynb` notebook.
- **Question 2**: Analysis using the `prices_industryoil.csv` dataset. The solution is divided into two parts:
  - The initial analysis is provided in the `python.ipynb` notebook.
  - Further processing and computations are handled in the `new.py` script.
- **Question 3**: The solution is provided in the `python.ipynb` notebook.
- **Question 4**: This involves working with the `services.csv` dataset. The solution is provided in the `python.ipynb` notebook.

## How to Use

1. **Running the Notebook**: Open `python.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment to review the solutions for Questions 1, 2, and 4. Execute the cells to reproduce the results.

2. **Running the Python Script**: To execute the solution for Question 2, run `new.py` in a Python environment. Ensure that the required datasets (`prices_industryoil.csv`) are in the same directory as the script.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries
